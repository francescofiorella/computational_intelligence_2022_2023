# Computational Intelligence 2022/2023

This repo contains the lab solutions and the exam project for the Computational Intelligence master's course of Politecnico di Torino.

The explored topics are:
1. Set Covering with breath first, depth first and A* algorithms.
2. Set Covering with evolution algorithm.
3. Policy search for the Nim game: agents using fixed rules, evolved rules, minmax, and reinforcement learning.
4. Quarto: agents using fixed rules, evolved rules, minmax, and reinforcement learning.
