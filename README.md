# Computational Intelligence 2022/2023

This repository contains my lab solutions for the Computational Intelligence master course of Politecnico di Torino.

The laboratories topic are:
1. Set Covering with breath first, depth first and A* algorithms.
2. Set Covering with evolution algorithm.
3. Policy search for the Nim game: agents using fixed rules, evolved rules, minmax, and reinforcement learning.

Credits to prof. Giovanni Squillero, and his [course repository](https://github.com/squillero/computational-intelligence).
