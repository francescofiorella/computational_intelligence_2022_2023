The used algorithms is the `Depth-First`, as a matter of fact, `A*` does not provides better results.
The `A*` heuristic function calculate the difference between N and the new state.

| N | Number of elements Ls | Number of nodes | Algorithm |
| :---: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 5 | 5 | 17 | Depth-First |
| 10 | 11 | 62 | Depth-First |
| 20 | 28  | 74 | Depth-First |
| 100 | 173 | 1603 | Depth-First |
| 500 | 1304 | 10778 | Depth-First |
| 1000 | 2893 | 24238 | Depth-First |
